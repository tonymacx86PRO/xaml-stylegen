# This is a neural network to create mass styles for xaml wpf programs
Requirements:
- Install tensorflow for your CPU or GPU
- Install requirements.txt

How to use this neuronal network:
- Create your first baseline or template csv labels file with labelsgen.py
- Edit and tweak the labels file with help of nn-structure.md
- Train the neural network with data, model name, and epochs with train.py
- Run your model to generate a couple of files with different styles

## P.S: This neural network will not have a any paper because this is a crazy idea from my friend and I'm still new to TensorFlow so don't judge too harshly.
